# image-to-trajectory
This repo contains the code to train a model to convert images of simple 2d trajectories to parameters of the trajectory in space of radial basis functions coefficients. This structure can be seen as a encoder-decoder framework wehre the decoder part is known ( converitng rbf values to trajectory images ). The encoder part tries to learn a model to find an efficient embedding which in this case is multimodal, reffering to different ways a trajectory can be parameterized.
